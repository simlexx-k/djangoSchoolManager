Next immediate steps:
1. Complete the authentication system by adding password reset functionality.
2. Start implementing the dashboard views in the administrator app for each user type.
3. Begin work on the Student Management system, as it's a core feature of the school management system.

As you progress through these steps, remember to:
- Regularly commit your changes to version control.
- Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and follow Django best practices.
- Continuously test your implementations to catch and fix issues early.
- Regularly update project documentation as you add new features.
